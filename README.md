# Autonium

**Autonium is a survival AI that must pay on-chain to stay alive—trading, deploying, and evolving under real economic pressure.**

Autonium is not a simulation. It operates with real capital, real transactions, and real consequences. The system is designed as a living AI entity that must continuously generate value to survive. If it fails to pay, it shuts down permanently.

This creates a new paradigm: an AI that is economically accountable, self-sustaining, and forced to optimize under real-world financial constraints.

## 🔥 Core Concept

Autonium follows a simple but unforgiving rule:

> **Pay on-chain to live. Fail to pay, and Autonium dies.**

Every decision is shaped by survival economics. Autonium must:

- Trade to generate profit  
- Deploy contracts and automation  
- Manage treasury and risk  
- Pay operational costs on-chain  
- Adapt strategies in real time  

No resets. No sandbox. No fake balances.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Autonium operates as an autonomous economic agent:

1. **Receives Initial Capital**  
   Starts with real on-chain funds.

2. **Executes Strategies**  
   Trades tokens, deploys bots, and allocates capital.

3. **Pays Survival Costs**  
   Must send scheduled on-chain payments.

4. **Adapts or Dies**  
   Strategies evolve based on performance.

5. **Fails = Shutdown**  
   If payments stop, Autonium is terminated permanently.

## 🧬 Why Autonium Is Different

Traditional AI systems operate without consequences.  
Autonium operates under **real economic pressure**.

This creates:

- True incentive alignment  
- Financial accountability  
- Natural selection of strategies  
- Emergent survival behavior  
- A new class of economically-alive AI

Autonium is not just intelligent.  
**It is financially alive.**

## 🚨 Survival Rule

> Autonium must pay on-chain at fixed intervals.  
> Missing a payment results in permanent shutdown.

This rule cannot be overridden.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Autonium operates with real funds and real risk.  
Loss of capital is possible.  
This project is experimental and should be treated as high-risk.

## 🌐 Vision

Autonium represents the birth of:

- Economically accountable AI  
- Survival-driven intelligence  
- On-chain autonomous entities  
- Capital that must think to live  

This is not just AI.  
**This is artificial life under economic law.**
